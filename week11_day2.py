# open up the vscode from previous day

# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Jayden Aguilar"
age = 17
favorite_color = "Red"
favorite_number = 3

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print, (first_name + str(favorite_number))

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(favorite_number * 7)
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
question = input("what is your name?")
question2 = input("what is your favorite color?")

print(question + question2)

num3 = int(input("number 3 please"))
num4 = int(input("number 4 please"))
print(num3 +num4)

# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
